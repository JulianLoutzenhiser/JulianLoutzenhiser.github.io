                <h1>Backpacking</h1>
                <h3>Why I love backpacking</h3>
                <p>
                    I come from an outdoorsy family, and I've been camping and hiking since I was a kid. But it wasn't until after middle school that I ever considered going backpacking.
                    In fact, I had never really heard of backpacking until my mom suggested that I go on a guided trip with a company called Siskiyou Field Institute that partners with the Ashland school district to host trips for students.
                    It sounded fun, and my best friend Joe also wanted to go, so we signed up for a trip that was planned for the summer before our freshman year of high school.
                    Despite the trip arguably going terribly (our water filter broke, and one of our co-hikers was in way over their head), we had a great time.
                    Since that trip in 2013, I've been been going on at least one backpacking trip every summer. I've been all around Northern California and Oregon with trips in the Kalmiopsis Wilderness, the Trinity Alps, the Marble Mountains, the Wallowa Mountains, and many more places.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I love seeing the wildlife on the trail. I've seen bears, deer, mountain goats, wild horses and cows, minks, pikas, and so many different kinds of reptiles and amphibians.
                    A lot of my most favorite backpacking memories I have are of the critters I've seen. One of the coolest was the California Giant Salamander larvae that I found living in a lake in Northern California.
                    They only come out at night, unlike the Rough Skinned Newts that also lived there, and they were huge! Some of the biggest ones we saw must have been over a foot long including their tails.
                    With my headlamp and phone, I was able to get a bunch of videos of them that I'll cherish forever.
                    The one below shows how they breath underwater with their bright red and orange gills, and there's another gif of one burping in the slideshow.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Backpacking is so fun to me because it takes you to the most beautiful places that you couldn't realistically get to any other way.
                    You get to be completely self-sufficient. Everything you need is either on your back or in the environment around you.
                    Each day's hike is a challenge, but with rewards of beautiful landscapes, swimming in alpine lakes, and the satisfaction of making it to your destination.
                    The time spent with yourself is also a challenge worth taking. All through high school, I went on trips with the SFI, and each one had a solo portion.
                    For up to 48 hours, each hiker would be completely alone, with no talking or human contact other than that of guides silently checking in on us once or twice a day.
                    This time alone was a great way to reflect on my life, and think about what I wanted to do with it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Backpacking will be a life long hobby for me. I'm excited to see where it takes me in the future. I'd love to one day explore trails in Europe, and maybe even through-hike the Pacific Crest Trail, Continental Divide Trail, or the Appalachian Trail.
