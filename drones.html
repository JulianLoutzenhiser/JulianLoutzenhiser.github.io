                <h1>FPV Drones</h1>
                <h3>What are FPV drones?</h3>
                <p>
                    FPV is a fairly new hobby that has exploded in popularity over the past half decade.
                    FPV (First Person View) drones are a type of remote-controlled aircraft that provide the pilot with a real-time video feed from the drone's perspective.
                    This immersive experience is achieved by transmitting live video from a camera mounted on the drone to a pair of goggles or a monitor worn by the pilot.
                    FPV drones are popular in various applications, including racing, freestyle flying, aerial photography, and videography.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Unlike other commercial drones, like those sold by DJI, FPV drones are fully manually controlled by the pilot.
                    There are no GPS or altitude hold features, so the pilot must constantly adjust the throttle, pitch, roll, and yaw to keep the drone in the air.
                    Also unlike commercial drones, FPV drones are built by hobbyists from individual components, which allows for a high degree of customization and repairability.
                    This is necessary because FPV drones crash a lot, and repairing and upgrading them is a big part of the hobby.

                <h3>My time with the hobby</h3>
                <p>
                    I got into FPV with my friend Ian; the same friend I started photography with. We had already been doing photography together for some time, and we wanted something new to learn.
                    FPV is quite expensive, and it takes a big investment to get started. Luckily, there's a way that you can try it out without spending a lot of money.
                    Before I ever flew a real drone, I spent many hours practicing on a simulator. This helped me learn the basics of flying and build up muscle memory and confidence for the controls.
                    With the knowledge that I could at least fly a drone in the simulator, I built my first drone and bought the rest of the necessary gear to get started.
                    Learning to build an FPV drone was a big challenge. I had built a computer before, but this was a whole new level of complexity.
                    I had to learn about soldering, reading wiring diagrams, and configuring software on the drone and the radio controller.
                    All with minimal instructions because the hobby is so new and the technology is changing so fast.
                    The maiden flight of my first drone was super exciting and nerve-wracking. But with practice comes confidence, and I was soon flying with my friends and exploring new places.
                    Because of the expense, and going back to school, I haven't been able to fly as much as I would like. But I still love the hobby and I'm excited to see where it goes in the future.
                    <a href="https://www.instagram.com/ianjesr/" target="_blank">Ian was able to make it into his full-time job</a>. I'm excited to see where it takes him. When I have more time and money to spend, I'll definitely be getting back into the hobby.
